# Code samples for using Collectipro data
What can you build with [Collectipro data](https://collectipro.com/access/introduction)? The code snippets in this repository will help you get acquainted with the Collectipro API and Bulk Download features.

The current samples are:
1. **Edition Purchase History.** Using the Collectipro API, plot the purchase price history of a particular edition (an edition is the combo of a particular play as part of a particular set).
2. **Predict Future Prices.** Using the Collectipro API, extrapolate the future price value of a certain edition based on past trends.
3. **Track Top Shot growth.** Using Collectipro's Bulk Download feature, view Top Shot's growth over time by both purchase volume and market event frequency.
4. **Find Best Time of Day.** Analyze trends in purchase price throughout the day to find the best hour to buy a moment.

To look at the source code for each sample, please see the python-code/ folder. To look at the data visualization output images corresponding to each sample, please see the output-images/ folder.
