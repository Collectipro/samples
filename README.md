# Code Samples
What can you build with Collectipro data? The code snippets in this repository will help you get acquainted with the Collectipro API and Bulk Download features.

The current samples are:
1. Edition Purchase History. Using the Collectipro API, plot the purchase price history of a particular edition (an edition is the combo of a particular play as part of a particular set).
2. Predict Future Prices. Using the Collectipro API, extrapolate the future price value of a certain edition based on past trends.
3. Track Top Shot growth. Using Collectipro's Bulk Download feature, view Top Shot's growth over time by both purchase volume and market event frequency.
4. Find Best Time of Day. Analyze trends in purchase price throughout the day to find the best hour to buy a moment.
